# Luke's Void Linux Rice

![pic1](pic1.png)

These are the files to my Void Linux Rice.

## Programs whose configs can be found here

+ i3 (i3-gaps)
+ urxvt (rxvt-unicode)
+ vim
+ bash
+ ranger
+ mutt/msmtp/offlineimap (For offline syncing of email, with configs easy to change to a gmail account)
+ calcurse
+ Music on Console (moc and mocp)
+ mpv
+ neofetch
+ compton (For transparency and to stop screen tearing)
+ And many little scripts I use

## Differences from my Arch and Parabola Rices

+ Void uses a different pacakge manager and init system than Arch/Parabola, thus some of the relevant shortcuts have been changed.
+ This rice uses ALSA only, and **not** PulseAudio. This makes for a more minimal system, but there is some functionality of the Parabola rice not present here yet, specifically, I don't have a way of recording system sounds yet, or using music visualizers. If you have more experience than me in getting these to work, please email me your solution! [luke@lukesmith.xyz](mailto:lukesmith.xyz)
