## Differences from my Arch and Parabola Rices

+ **Since Void is more or less my main distro now, this repo is more likely to get updates over time.** The Arch and Parabola repos may get some, changes, but will remain mostly the same.
+ Void uses a different pacakge manager and init system than Arch/Parabola, thus some of the relevant shortcuts have been changed.
+ This rice uses ALSA only, and **not** PulseAudio. This makes for a more minimal system, but there is some functionality of the Parabola rice not present here yet, specifically, I don't have a way of recording system sounds yet, or using music visualizers. If you have more experience than me in getting these to work, please email me your solution! [luke@lukesmith.xyz](mailto:lukesmith.xyz)
+ I use only Firefox on my Void Machine, not qutebrowser, so there are no qutebrowser configs here.
